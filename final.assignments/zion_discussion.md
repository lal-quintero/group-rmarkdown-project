Method:
LDA alone may be used to detect counterfeits, if lower fidelity is desired.
(results pre cluster analysis identify some traits which may pick out whether a scotch could be counterfeit, or at the very least non-provenance)

Based on the LDA/clustering analysis, TXRF as a novel means of counterfeit detection appears to be a sound methodology with a reasonable degree of success and accuracy, when care is taken with distance selection, methodology and appropriate selection of number of clusters - varying results and levels of accuracy
This method could be applied to other types of liquor/alcohol, but would need to undergo the same exploratory analysis

Points of improvement for further studies:
Unsure if what weâ€™re picking up on in some cases
Grains are the weakest group in terms of identification across the board: grains/blends may be more likely to be misclassified as counterfeit, rather than misclassified as provenance. This could mean some explanatory variables, such as the age of the whisky (as provenance whiskies are long aged, while grain and blends are typically younger in age)
Regionality may also be something indicated by TXRF results
Further and more varying data required to look into these ideas.

TODO:
- [] Incorporate overview, aims, and hypothesis response as a structure to the discussion, and answer/respond to each using relevant data points and observations
- [] Brief commentary on results and how they relate back to the above
- [] Take my handwritten notes from data exploration and observation and incorporate them into the discussion
- [] At least one statistic on counterfeit whisky/liquors, in support of the further uses of this technique on counterfeit detection

Placeholder discussion points
`Best method, LDA could be used as well to detect counterfeits if lower fidelity is desired. XTRF appears to be a sound method for discriminating malt, grain counterfeits across cluster type though care should be taken with hierarchical clustering in choosing an applicable distance, as results varied widely both in counterfeit discrimination as well as grain/blend and counterfeit discrimination.`

`More data/different data may be needed to truly discern providence. XTRF has been used to sample metals, compounds imparted by wood, etc; aging process may be more distinguishable than region as the main thing separating classes are chemicals ________, likely derived from whether the whisky is grain, malt (of providence) or a counterfeit (likely additives). Interestingly 2 island whiskies (______ and _______) were very distinct from all other samples, as seen in PC space and euclidian clustering`
